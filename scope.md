# Overview

As a beginning programmer, choosing and following through with a project can be difficult. Random Project addresses this problem by assigning a random project based on difficulty level and subject matter.

Only one random project idea can be generated every 24 hours unless a previous project has been completed. This encourages budding programmers to follow through instead of window shopping for the perfect idea. Users may bypass the 24 hr limit for a nominal fee.

# Planned features

* Generate a random project idea based on difficulty and/or subject matter.

* Submit a scope for your project.

* Set a deadline for yourself and (optionally) put money on the line, donated to charity if the project isn't completed in time.

* Link to your project's github repository.
